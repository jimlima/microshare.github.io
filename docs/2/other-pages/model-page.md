## Summary
---------------------------------------

The page should always open with a outline of what the page entails, no matter the size of the page. This makes navigation much smoother and decreases the time between getting that answer to the user.

1. [The list will be in numbered list format](./#general-formatting)
2. [Each Point will have a quick link](./#other-standards)


## General Formatting
---------------------------------------
Each section should be titled in header 2 (This is ## in markdown). Each section should have a line break before the section header to visually show the end of the previous topic. The line break should appear directly under the last line of the section, no spatial break in between. 

### Sub Section

If the section has a sub section, make sure to give the sub section a title in header 3(This is ### in markdown).


## Bulleted versus Numbered Lists
---------------------------------------

A numbered list should be used for:
<br>
**1.** There are steps and the user needs to follow the information in a direct manner.
<br>
**2.** The numbered list should be bolded with line breaks in between for aesthetic purposes.  


- A bullet point list should be used if:
* The information given does not follow a strict order of instruction and the information is more free flowing.
* You can use a * or a - in markdown to signify a bullet point.
    - If the list has lots of nested points

Both styles of lists should include a period at the end of the sentence. 

<br>
##### Sections should be numbered or bulleted similarly. If the order of the sections is critical [like a roadmap](/docs/2/technical/quick-start/basic-dev-roadmap/), then the sections should be numbered. Else if the section topics can be jumped between each other, the sections do not need to be numbered. 




## Other Standards
---------------------------------------

<br> Microshare™ should be used in the title of the page only and refer to Microshare® in the body of the documentation.

<br>
`emails` or `objects` should be given in this form.

<br>
[All links should be easily followed](https://microshare.github.io).

<br>
[Mentioned sections](./#bulleted-versus-numbered-lists) should be linked.
