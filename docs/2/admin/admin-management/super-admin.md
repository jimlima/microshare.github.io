### 1. Create the Organization
---------------------------------------

<br>
In order to create the organization, you must login with an Admin account, which only a select few have the ability to do. You must be logged into a microshare.io user account and have the "isAdmin" setting activated for the "pointdefau" identity. 

<br>

<br>
**1.** Org Name is for the Organization & Identity Combined. 

* This is user facing text which is visible on the Microshare® platform in the User dropdown under 'Switch Identities'. 

<br>
**2.** Org Domain should be the official domain of the organization (typically where the corporate webpage is located). eg. Comcast.com. 

* This is required to include a valid internet extension and a valid top level domain. 

<br>
**3.** For example amazon.co,uk is valid, but neither co.uk nor amazon are valid. 

* Identity Identifier must be unique in the system, can be dot separated, should be lowercase. eg. Aramark.admin. 

<br>
**4.** Administrator email is the intended organization administrator, will "invite" the admin by sending an email to that address and `support@microshare.io`. Typically `ms_admin@domain`. 

<br>
**5.** The full identity string will be reversed domain + identity identifier so org domain 'microshare.io' + identifier 'admin' will be io.microshare.admin. 


### 2. Create the ms_admin account
