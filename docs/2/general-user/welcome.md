## Introduction
---------------------------------------

Microshare® provides Data Strategy as a Service, enabling our clients to quickly capture previously hidden data insights that produce cost savings, sustainability metrics and business opportunities. Our solutions produce data on Day One, installed at scale quickly by non-technical staff and operate separate from sensitive corporate IT networks. Our solutions create a Digital Twin of your physical assets, providing comprehensive picture of their performance, the risks they face going forward, and the steps required to produce maximum returns from these assets.

The Microshare® documentation guides all users through the process of using the Microshare® tools so that they can capitalize on their data.

## Platform
---------------------------------------
{% include image.html url="\assets\img\banner.jpg"  description="ms logo" %}

The Microshare® platform is comprised of two cooperating clusters of microservices: **Microshare® Core** and **Microshare® Stream**.

Microshare® Core combines a data lake architecture, a simple RESTful API to allow programmatic interaction with data objects, and a contextual security, rules engine to make policy decisions. 
The API allows storage (via POST) and retrievals (via GET). The [data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) will store any type of data that can be serialized to JSON. Your data is stored in an annotated but unmodified form inside of the data lake. Retrieval operations consider the policy established by a data owner before granting or rejecting any requested operation.

Microshare® Stream provides a scalable architecture for intelligent data enrichment and complex event processing. 
Robots are microservices that can be setup to take action when a triggering event occurs. 
Triggering events may include timed events (scheduled start), new data introduction, and policy invocation. 
You can create your own unique logic by writing Javascript functions inside of a Robot Configuration.

These two entities are grouped together on the Microshare® platform. This one is **Microshare® Composer**, indeed the interest of this platform is to be able to build different tools that can work together to create applications, intelligent and extremely efficient workflows.
