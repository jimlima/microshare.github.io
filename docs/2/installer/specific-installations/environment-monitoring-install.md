**Note**

Using your Microshare solutions safely

- Follow the stated battery requirements before installing any batteries. 
- Never force a connector into a port. If the connector and port don't join with reasonable ease, they probably don&#39;t match. Make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to the port.
- Protect Microshare sensors from direct sunlight, wherever possible.
- Use Microshare solutions in environments according to their specification. Most products arefor indoor use only. 
- There are no user-serviceable parts inside Microshare sensors. For service personnel: Always unplug external power supply, remove batteries, and turn off UPS battery before service operation. 
- Microshare sensors may be damaged by improper storage or handling. Take care not to drop them during transport and installation.

### SE01 – Environment Monitoring

The Environment Monitoring solution from Microshare is a complete sensing service for facilities managers looking to monitor the indoor air and environment quality around their buildings. 

What’s in the box? In terms of deploying quickly, the Environment Monitoring solution from Microshare includes long-life battery-operated wireless sensors, which can be easily and discreetly installed around buildings, device connectivity, access to data and alerts via Microshare Business Tools dashboards or direct API access to data through the Microshare Smart Network.

**Installation instructions:**

| --- | --- |
| **1.** **Activating the sensor** <br>- Our wireless sensors are pre-installed with batteries. To activate pull the shipping isolating battery tab from the sensor.<br>-	The LED on the sensor should begin to flash intermittently.<br> | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/install_environment/EnvironmentSensor.jpg" description="Environment Sensor" %} |
| **2.** **Preparing the sensor for fixing** <br><br>- Using a suitable adhesive tape, **ensure that you place the tape on the opposite side of the QR code, covering the QR code will prevent you from using the Deploy-M app to add your device to the system.** | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/install_environment/tabs_side_adhesive.png" description="Sensor with adhesive tape" %}|
| **3.** **Registering the sensor using the Deploy-M app [iOS & Android]** <br><br>- You should already have the Deploy-M app and login details as part of your project set-up with Microshare<br>- Login using your credentials, if you are unsure or require assistance, please contact [installation@microshare.io](mailto:installation@microshare.io) | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image12.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Select the correct device cluster for the devices you are installing. <br> Note – a "Device Cluster" is simply grouping of sensors, usually in one space, that helps identify and annotate the data you receive from your Microshare solution. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image13.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Select the correct location where the device will be installed.<br>
- Click Add | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image14.png" description="Banner" %}  |
| - Once the sensor has been added to the correct location on the app, click & RESCAN to open the devices camera | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image15.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Scan the QR code located on the Sensor | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/install_environment/EnvironmentSensor_DMScan.jpg" description="QR Code Scan on Deploy-M app" %} |
| - Check that the Dev EUI [usually the second code on the sensor under the QR code] the shown matches the one on your device, then select save from the bottom of the screen. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image17.png" description="Banner" %} |
| **4.** **Fixing the Environment Monitoring sensor** <br><br>- Once you have completed the registration of the sensor on the Deploy-M app, you are ready to fix the sensor in place.<br>-	Peel the adhesive sticker on the back of the device and attach in the pre-assigned location. We recommend attaching the sensor out of reach. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/install_environment/EnvironmentSensor_attached.png" description="Banner" %} |
