Using your Microshare solutions safely

-   Follow the stated battery requirements before installing any
    batteries. 

-   Never force a connector into a port. If the connector and port don't
    join with reasonable ease, they probably don't match. Make sure that
    the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the
    connector correctly in relation to the port.

-   Protect Microshare sensors from direct sunlight, wherever possible.

-   Use Microshare solutions in environments according to their
    specification. Most products arefor indoor use only. 

-   There are no user-serviceable parts inside Microshare sensors. For
    service personnel: Alwaysunplug external power supply, remove
    batteries, and turn off UPS battery before service operation. 

-   Microshare sensors may be damaged by improper storage or handling.
    Take care not to drop them during transport and installation.

**SC01 -- Activity Level Indicator**

The Activity Level Indicator solution from Microshare is a complete
sensing service for facilities manager looking to gain better insights,
improve security and develop new usage applications around their
facilities.

What's in the box? In terms of deploying quickly, the Activity Level
Indicator solution from Microshare includes long-life (up to two years)
battery-operated wireless sensors, which can be easily and discreetly
installed at key points around your facilities, device connectivity,
access to data and alerts via Microshare for Business dashboards or
direct API access to data through Microshare Smart Network. 

Note: In order to reduce the possibility of recording false alerts, a
simple cap is pre-fitted to the sensor unit to limit the sensing range
of the device. This ensures that only activity within the required line
of sight is measured.

**Installation instructions:**


| --- | --- |
| **1.** **Activating the wireless sensor** <br>- Our wireless sensors are pre-installed with batteries. To activate pull the shipping isolating battery tab from the sensor.<br>- After around a minute, the LED on the sensor should begin to flash intermittently. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_0.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **2.** **Preparing the sensor for fixing** <br><br>- If you are fixing the sensor using suitable adhesive tape, ensure that you place the tape on the opposite side of the QR code. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_1.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **3.** **Registering the sensor using the Deploy-M app [iOS &amp; Android]** <br><br>- You should already have the Deploy-M app and login details as part of your project set-up with Microshare<br>- Login using your credentials, if you are unsure or require assistance, please contact [installation@microshare.io](mailto:installation@microshare.io) | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_2.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Select the correct device cluster for the devices you are installing. <br> Note – a &quot;Device Cluster&quot; is simply grouping of sensors, usually in one space, that helps identify and annotate the data you receive from your Microshare solution.| {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_3.png" description="Banner" %}  |
| - Select the correct location where the device will be installed.<br>
- Click Add | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_4.png" description="Banner" %}  |
| - Once the sensor has been added to the correct location on the app, click &#39;RESCAN&#39; to open the devices camera | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_5.png" description="Banner" %}|
| - Scan the QR code located on the Sensor | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_6.png" description="Banner" %}|
| - Check that the Dev EUI [usually the second code on the sensor under the QR code] the shown matches the one on your device, then select save from the bottom of the screen. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_7.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **4.** **Fixing the sensor bracket** <br><br>- -	Once you have completed the registration of the sensor on the Deploy-M app, you are ready to fix the sensor in place.<br>-	This sensor is usually installed along the top of a door frame (on the inside of the room), with the sensing element pointed down and the QR code facing towards you. If there is no space at the top of the door frame, the device can also be installed on the top right or left of the doorframe, depending on which way the door opens - the main point to note is that the sensing element faces down and into the room being monitored. <br>-	Using the adhesive on the sensor, attach the sensor with the QR code still visible and the sensor pointing downwards as shown. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/activity_monitor/activity_monitor_8.png" description="Banner" %}|
