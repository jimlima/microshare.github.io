### 1. Open Battery Compartment and Remove Battery​

* Using a coin or similar flat, unsharpened object, loosen the screw-on cover located on the underside of the device.​

* Insert a flathead/slotted jeweler’s screwdriver into the small opening next to the battery. *Be careful to insert the screwdriver between the battery and the positive contact*​

* Lift gently upward; the battery will pop free with minimal resistance.​

* Test the battery using a multimeter or other battery tester. Replace if battery produces less than 3 volts.​

### 2. Identifying the Battery Contacts​

* The negative contact, sitting on the battery compartment floor, resembles a fork.​

* The positive contact, standing against one side of the compartment, follows the compartment's contour and is roughly V-shaped.

### 3. Bend the Negative Contact Slightly Upward 

* Carefully slide the jeweler’s screwdriver under the middle fork of the contact. Avoid damaging the surface of the circuit board to which it is mounted.​

* Lift the contact slightly; a millimeter at most. The contact need be raised only as much as is necessary to allow it to remain raised once the screwdriver is removed.​

### 4. Reinsert the Battery and Reattach the Cover

* Using fingers, place the edge of the battery against the positive battery contact.​

* Press firmly downward near the side of the battery closest to the finger-shaped indent in the battery receptacle. The battery will snap into place.​

* The device can be tested at this point to ensure the battery is seated correctly.​

* Once successfully tested, reattach the cover and test again.
