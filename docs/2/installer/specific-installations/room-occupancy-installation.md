**Installation instructions:**

| --- | --- |
| **1.** **Activating the wireless sensor** <br>- Our wireless sensors are pre-installed with batteries. To activate pull the shipping isolating battery tab from the sensor.<br>- After around a minute, the LED on the sensor should begin to flash intermittently. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_0.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **2.** **Preparing the sensor for fixing** <br><br>- If you are fixing the sensor using suitable adhesive tape, ensure that you place the tape on the opposite side of the QR code. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_1.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **3.** **Registering the sensor using the Deploy-M app [iOS &amp; Android]** <br><br>- You should already have the Deploy-M app and login details as part of your project set-up with Microshare<br>- Login using your credentials, if you are unsure or require assistance, please contact [installation@microshare.io](mailto:installation@microshare.io) | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_2.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Select the correct device cluster for the devices you are installing. <br> Note – a &quot;Device Cluster&quot; is simply grouping of sensors, usually in one space, that helps identify and annotate the data you receive from your Microshare solution.| {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_3.png" description="Banner" %}  |
| - Select the correct location where the device will be installed.<br>
- Click Add | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_4.png" description="Banner" %}  |
| - Once the sensor has been added to the correct location on the app, click &#39;RESCAN&#39; to open the devices camera | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_5.png" description="Banner" %}|
| - Scan the QR code located on the Sensor | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_6.png" description="Banner" %}|
| - Check that the Dev EUI [usually the second code on the sensor under the QR code] the shown matches the one on your device, then select save from the bottom of the screen. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_7.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **4.** **Fixing the sensor bracket** <br><br>- Peel the sticker on the back of the provided bracket and attach it to the ceiling or other surface in a good vantage point for the room.<br>- Using the field of vision image shown above, install the device at a position and angle that best places the space within range of the sensing element. Typically, these devices are installed in the middle of the room where the wall meets the ceiling. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_8.png" description="Banner" %}|
| **5.** **Fixing the sensor** <br><br>- Once you have completed the registration of the sensor on the Deploy-M app, you are ready to fix the sensor in place. <br> - Using the adhesive pad on the sensor, attach to the bracket with the QR code still visible, at approximately a 45-degree angle with the PIR sensor and LED facing into the room | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/installation_tabs/room_occupancy/room_occupancy_9.png" description="Banner" %}|
