Using your Microshare solutions safely

- Follow the stated battery requirements before installing any batteries. 
- Never force a connector into a port. If the connector and port don't join with reasonable ease, they probably don&#39;t match. Make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to the port.
- Protect Microshare sensors from direct sunlight, wherever possible.
- Use Microshare solutions in environments according to their specification. Most products arefor indoor use only. 
- There are no user-serviceable parts inside Microshare sensors. For service personnel: Always unplug external power supply, remove batteries, and turn off UPS battery before service operation. 
- Microshare sensors may be damaged by improper storage or handling. Take care not to drop them during transport and installation.

### SM02 – Fridge Monitoring

The Fridge Monitoring solution from Microshare is a complete sensing service for facilities managers looking to monitor the temperature in fridges and other cold storage areas. 

What’s in the box? In terms of deploying quickly, the Fridge Monitoring solution from Microshare includes long-life battery-operated wireless sensor with temperature sensing probes, device connectivity, access to data and alerts via Microshare for Business dashboards or direct API access to data through Microshare Smart Network.

In order to install the solution, you will also need zip ties and a magnet, not provided.


**Installation instructions:**

| --- | --- |
| **1.** **Activating the sensor** <br>- Our wireless sensors are pre-installed with batteries. To activate simply hold a magnet against the raised circle highlighted in the picture. You will know the device is activated as the device LED's will flash through the plastic in the bottom of the device<br> | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/Installation_fridge/FridgeSensor1.png" description="Fridge Sensor" %} |
| **2.** **Preparing the sensor for fixing** <br><br>- If you are fixing the sensor using suitable adhesive tape, ensure that you place the tape on the opposite side of the QR code. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/Installation_fridge/FridgeSensor2.png" description="Fridge Sensor" %}|
| **3.** **Registering the sensor using the Deploy-M app [iOS & Android]** <br><br>- You should already have the Deploy-M app and login details as part of your project set-up with Microshare<br>- Login using your credentials, if you are unsure or require assistance, please contact [installation@microshare.io](mailto:installation@microshare.io) | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image12.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Select the correct device cluster for the devices you are installing. <br> Note – a "Device Cluster" is simply grouping of sensors, usually in one space, that helps identify and annotate the data you receive from your Microshare solution. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image13.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Select the correct location where the device will be installed.<br>
- Click Add | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image14.png" description="Banner" %}  |
| - Once the sensor has been added to the correct location on the app, click & RESCAN to open the devices camera | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image15.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Scan the QR code located on the Sensor | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/Installation_fridge/FridgeSensor_QR_DM.png" description="Banner" %} |
| - Check that the Dev EUI [usually the second code on the sensor under the QR code] the shown matches the one on your device, then select save from the bottom of the screen. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/leak-installation/Image16.png" description="Banner" %} |
| **4.** **Fixing the fridge Monitoring sensor** <br><br>- Once you have completed the registration of the sensor on the Deploy-M app, you are ready to fix the sensor in place.<br>-	Peel the adhesive sticker on the back of the device and stick the device to the outside of the fridge in the pre-assigned location. | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/Installation_fridge/FridgeSensorFitted.png" description="Banner" %} |
| -	Once the sensor housing is secure, stick the adhesive pads to the cable roughly an inch [2.5cm] from the probe (which is at the end of the cable) as shown | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/Installation_fridge/FridgeSensorProbe.png" description="Banner" %} |
| -	Secure the probe inside of the fridge using the adhesive strips which you attached. We recommend installing the probe in the top of the fridge | {% include image.html url="/assets/img/Installation_fridge/FridgeSensorProbeFitted.png" description="Banner" %} |
