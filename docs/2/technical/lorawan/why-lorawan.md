## 1. Introduction

In this block of documentation you will be able to learn more about LoRaWan technology, understand in detail how the network, sensors and gateways work. 

But first of all we would like to briefly remind you why we have chosen this technology for some of our sensors. 


If you want more technical information on these points, do not hesitate to visit the [LoRaWan Technology page](/docs/2/technical/lorawan/lorawan-technology/).


## 2. LoRaWan Advantages

<br>

#### Long Range

First of all the LoRaWan technology is a long range technology, so in your building you will not have any problem of connection with your sensors as you could have with wifi or bluetooth. Indeed you will be able to simply cover a large building with a single gateway, without disturbing your network. 

To give you an idea of what you can do outdoors, we have captured a message between a device and a gateway more than 15 km away, and it works just as well indoors.



#### Long Battery Life

The LoRaWan technology is a godsend for the sensors, although it sets a certain regulation and emission rules, it allows the sensors to consume very little at emission, the sensors can thus remain functional on their original battery up to 5 or 7 years.



#### Plug and Play

What could be easier than an easy-to-install technology?

Simply by activating a sensor it will work for years and send you your essential data, we call it the lick and stick technology, just like a stamp. This technology coupled with our Deploy-M installation application and device management on our platform ensures success in the management of your devices.



#### Security

By passing through LoRaWan and not through your wifi for example, this ensures the continued security of your network. Indeed even if the sensors and technology LoRaWan embeds a strong security, we do not want there to be any possible entry into your network through a WiFi sensor for example.
