## Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Google Cloud Pub/Sub Integration is a streaming data integration that pushes data from the Smart Network into a client&#39;s Google Cloud Pub/Sub tenancy in real-time. Data is typically made available to Google Cloud Pub/Sub Topics, on which Subscribment can be set up to ensure that event handling and analytics are fed with the most current state of the measured space. Google Cloud Pub/Sub Integration creates a pathway to advanced storage, visualization, and analytics in the Google Cloud ecosystem from the Microshare® Smart Network.

### Client Side

**Requirements :**

 - Create a Service Account 
 - Generate a Key 

### Create a Service Account

In order to create a Service Account, first log into your Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_1.png" description="image 1" %}

Then go to **Menu &gt; API &amp; Services &gt; Credentials.**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_2.png" description="image 2" %}

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_3.png" description="image 3" %}

Click on **Create Credentials** and on **Service Account.**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_4.png" description="image 4" %}

Then you will have to give it name such as _&quot;Microshare_® _Data&quot;_ for example, and a **Service Account Id** , which could be the same as the name. And finally you can add your own **description**.

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_5.png" description="image 5" %}

Our example :

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_6.png" description="image 6" %}

Regarding the permissions, it is important to select **PubSub Editor** or **PubSub Admin** for better maintenance.

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_7.png" description="image 7" %}

You can leave the last page as is and click **Done.**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_8.png" description="image 8" %}

The Service Account is now set up, and the email is :

 - [Service Account Id]@[Project Name].iam.gserviceaccount.com

If at any time you need to change the role, you can change the settings for the email in the role interface.

Now let&#39;s **click on the created Service Account.**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_10.png" description="image 10" %}

Then **go to the bottom** of the page to find the **&quot;Keys&quot; section .**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_11.png" description="image 11" %}

And **Click on Add Key &gt; Create new Key.**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_12.png" description="image 12" %}

**Pick JSON** and click on **CREATE.**

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_13.png" description="image 13" %}
Your key is now **created** and **automatically downloaded** on your computer.

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_14.png" description="image 14" %}

You can open it to check that it&#39;s all right like that :

{% include image.html url="\assets\img\google-pub-sub\Pub_15.png" description="image 15" %}

Be careful to store and transmit the resulting file in a secure fashion. These access credentials are stored in plain text and are vulnerable to security leaks.

Your Microshare® Service or Support contact will need the **.json file**. It is recommended that this information be sent securely via GPG encrypted email or through an encrypted chat connection using keybase.io.
