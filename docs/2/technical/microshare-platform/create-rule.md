---------------------------------------

 The views used by the generic applications are generic views created by MicroshareÂ® and hosted on the account **asset@microshare.io**. 

These views are already shared with all accounts. You can find more information about this in the [views guide.](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/views-guide)

If a new view is created for the dashboards, it is necessary to follow the following steps:

 * Create [Rules](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/rules-guide/) to share the views to everyone through the **assets@microshare.io** account.  
 * The name should be "Share Views with <em>(insert client name)</em>"
