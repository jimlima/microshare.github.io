## 1. Introduction
---------------------------------------

The Microshare® platform is the epicenter of your data; the place where you will not only be able to view your data, but also mandate others’ restrictions, automate tasks and much more. 

There is a difference in what a general user and developer have the ability to do. The general user only has access to the data and tools administered by their admin. Meanwhile, the developer can access and view all of the tools. For instance, the developer can create device clusters, robots, rules, forms, change identities and access views while the general user can only view what data has been mandated to them. 



## 2. Setting up your Account
---------------------------------------

If you do not already have a developer account, follow the [Create an Account Tutorial](/docs/2/general-user/quick-start/create-an-account/) to get started. If you already have an account, continue reading this page and head over to [The developer login page]( https://dapp.microshare.io/login?requestURL=%2F). After, make sure to check out the [Technical Overview Page](/docs/2/technical/quick-start/overview/).

## 3. Tools and Abilities
---------------------------------------
Below is the list of the various tools and abilities you can expect to work with as a developer using the Microshare® platform:

### A. Device Cluster

Device clusters give you the ability to group data from sensors together. This is most useful for sensors in the same area. You can add devices to the cluster either through the Deploy M app or via the Microshare® platform (refer to the [Device Clusters Page](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/device-cluster-guide/)). You can view the cluster data in the dashboard. 

### B. Views

A view is a component for managing your data access. It lets you send static data, query the data lake, manage content and format data. Views also put controls over data along with sharing rules. You can learn how to create and manage views through the [Views Guide.](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/views-guide/)

### C. Dashboards

The dashboard is the place where you can view your apps. Your apps represent your devices’ data according to your preferences. [The Dashboard Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/dashboard-guide/) will walk you through creating apps for your devices and configuring your apps to your preferences. 

### D. Rules 

Rules allow the administrator to manage what data certain individuals can see. This enforces the security and shareability of your data. Refer to [The Rules Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/rules-guide/) to learn how to create and customize your data’s rules.

### E. Identities

Your identity determines what data you can view, and what tools you are able to access and/ or create. As a developer, you will be alternating between identities to change what you are able to view. Use [The Identities Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/identity-guide/) to learn how to create and alternate between your identities.

### F. Robots

Robots give the ability to automate certain tasks for your data. For example, you could program a robot to alert you if your sensor detects a significant temperature drop or if your meeting room is vacant. [The Robots Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/robots-guide/) will navigate you through the process of automating tasks according to your sensors, and [The Robot Library](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/robots-library/) is a great source to refer to examples of task automation in Microshare®.

### F. Data Ingestion

[The Data Ingestion Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/data-ingestion-guide/) will walk you through moving your data from several sources to the Microshare® data lake as microshares. Additionally, you can create a robot to automatically perform this task using [The Data Ingestion by Robots Guide.](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/data-ingestion-by-robots/)

### F. Data Unpacking

You can set up automated multi- step processes to route and transform your data so it’s ready to be consumed by an app or a dashboard using [The Data Unpacking Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/data-unpacking/) and automate this task using the [The Data Unpacking with Robots Guide](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform-advanced/data-unpacking-by-robots/).
