For a list of options, [see this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation).
* `dateFormat`: specifies how to display the date (default is "YYYY-MM-DD"). Could use the locale specific format as "LL" or "L". 
* `date`: preset the selected week (current week is the default) in the YYYY-MM-DD format. If you use a Sunday/ Monday and fail to explicitly set the locale and timezone, then users in different time zones will see the wrong week's worth of data.

* `autoDownload`: Download the file as soon as the page is loaded, the default is false.
